#sniffer

This program is written by C#, by using WinPcap (http://www.winpcap.org/) and SharpPcap (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharppcap/).

sniffer can realise some functions just like Wireshark, it can capture packet 
using multithread programming, and analyzes the packet by SharpPcap`s lib functions.
And of course it has a GUI.

run on windows!)`
